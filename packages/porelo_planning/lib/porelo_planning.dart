/// The planning screen: a project's stories and issues by state, their unsaved moves, and the start of their work.
///
/// The window gives it a `PlanningClient` to read and write through, and takes part through a few hooks: how a
/// start reaches it (`PlanningStartTask`), what the screen shows of a run (`PlanningTaskChanges`), the agents a start
/// may choose (`PlanningAgents`), and where the screen stands (`PlanningHost`). The package imports nothing of the
/// window; its colors come from the window's theme.
